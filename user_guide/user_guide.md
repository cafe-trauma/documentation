To fill out a questionnaire a user must first log into the application using a username and password.

Once they are logged in they will select if they are filling out a questionnaire for a trauma center or trauma system.

From here the user will answer questions from various categories, answers are immediately saved on the server so a user doesn't need to submit any forms.

However, there is a "next" button at the end of each section to guide the user forward although this merely advances the category and does not trigger a save.

At anytime the user can leave the page and come back to find all their answers still in place.  They will also be able to compare their organization to another at any time during the questionnaire process using the forthcoming visualization tools we are building.
